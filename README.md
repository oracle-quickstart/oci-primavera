The Terraform modules for Oracle Primavera Suite allow you to provision infrastructure for Oracle Primavera Suite on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using Terraform. Oracle Primavera suite can be deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in single availability domain or multi availability domain architecture. The modules can be used to create infrastructure for Oracle Primavera Suite in single Availability Domain as well as multiple Availability Domains.

If you want to deploy Oracle Primavera Suite on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in single availability domain architecture, set AD variable to one of the availability domain i.e. 1, 2 or 3.

```hcl
AD = ["1"]
```

## Information about Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resources built by Terraform modules for Oracle Primavera Suite
* It is recommended to use shared filesystem for Oracle Primavera Suite multi tier configuration. The Terraform modules create File     Storage service filesystem for single as well as multiple availability domain architecture. For a single availability domain architecture, a single filesystem is created. For multiple availability domain architecture, two such file systems are created, one in each availabilty domain.

* The filesystems can be synchronized by an rsync script in cron. The rsync snchronization script is placed in cron of root user and is commented by default. The script can be enabled to synchornize fileystems after implemenation of Oracle Primavera Suite.

  ```
  # Credits to lucas.gomes@oracle.com
  # crontab -l
  */30 * * * * /usr/bin/flock -n /var/run/fss-sync-up-file-system.lck rsync -aHAXxv --numeric-ids --delete /u01/install/APPS/ /u01/install/APPSDR/

  # cat /etc/cron.d/fss-sync-up-file-system
  */30 * * * * /usr/bin/flock -n /var/run/fss-sync-up-file-system.lck rsync -aHAXxv --numeric-ids --delete /u01/install/APPS /u01/install/APPSDR
  ```

* The Terraform modules creates one private load balancer for single availability domain architecture and two private load balancers for multiple availability domain architecture. For a multiple availability domain architecture, the backend set of each private load balancer has application servers from respective availablity domains.

* Separate pairs of SSH keys can be used for bastion host and rest of the compute infrastructure resources. It is also possible to use the same key. In that case, same key is required as input to instance and bastion instance variables in env-vars or env-vars.ps1 file.

  For example,
  ```
  ### Public/private keys used on the instance
  export TF_VAR_ssh_public_key=/home/oracle/tf/<mykey.pub>
  export TF_VAR_ssh_private_key=/home/oracle/tf/<mykey.pem>

  ### Public/private keys used on the bastion instance
  export TF_VAR_bastion_ssh_public_key=/home/oracle/tf/<mykey.pub>
  export TF_VAR_bastion_ssh_private_key=/home/oracle/tf/<mykey.pem>

  ```
  For terraform installations on Unix systems, the private half of SSH key pairs should be in OpenSSH format. The instances in private subnet can be reached via SSH on port 22 by allowing agent forwarding in Putty and using Putty authentication tool like Pageant. Note that this does not require copying private SSH key for instances to bastion host.

* The terraform modules ensure that application instances are deployed across different Fault Domains within an availability domain. Fault Domains protect against unexpected hardware failures and against planned outages due to compute hardware maintenance. For Real application clusters database, each node of cluster is deployed in a separate Fault domains by default.

* The terraform modules expose timezone variable which can be used to set timezone of provisioned compute instances. The modules uses cloud-init to do that. For database system, timezone has to be set manually using operating system specific procedure. Follow operating system specific documentation to do that.

* The Terraform modules always use latest Oracle Linux image for the chosen operating system for provisioning compute instances.
There are chances that minor version of operating system gets upgraded and a new image gets published in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure console. In that case, always check the available version of image from oracle Cloud Infrastructure compute console to input this value. For example, if Oracle Linux version is chnaged from version 7.5 to 7.6, change this value from 7.5 to 7.6.  

* The standby database has to be built manually after your Oracle Primavera Suite database is restored. For creating a standby database, see [Using Oracle Data Guard with the Database CLI](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/Tasks/usingDG.htm?tocpath=Services%7CDatabase%7CBare%20Metal%20and%20Virtual%20Machine%20DB%20Systems%7C_____11)

* The terraform version has been locked to 0.11.8 and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider version has been locked to 3.5.1 in provider.tf file. To use a version higher than these versions, change the values in the provider.tf file. The terraform modules may require changes for a successful run with a new terraform and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider version.


## Cloud-init template for application servers
Following is the cloud-init template used to install Oracle Primavera Suite prerequisite RPMs and mount shared file systems on application servers:

```yaml
#cloud-config
timezone: "${timezone}"

packages:
  - rsync
  - nfs-utils
  - ntp
  - oracle-ebs-server-R12-preinstall

runcmd:
  - sudo mkdir -p ${src_mount_path}
  - sudo mount ${src_mount_target_private_ip}:${src_export_path} ${src_mount_path}
  - sudo chown oracle:oinstall ${src_mount_path}
  - echo ${src_mount_target_private_ip}:${src_export_path} ${src_mount_path} nfs tcp,vers=3 >> /etc/fstab
  # Run firewall command to enable to open ports
  - firewall-offline-cmd --port=${app_instance_listen_port}:tcp
  - /bin/systemctl restart firewalld
```

## Unix bash commands to configure rsync on application servers.

These are the unix commands run to enable rsync across Oracle Primavera Suite application servers.

```
#/bin/bash
sudo mkdir -p ${dst_mount_path}
sudo mount ${dst_mount_target_private_ip}:${dst_export_path} ${dst_mount_path}
sudo chown oracle:oinstall ${dst_mount_path}
sudo crontab /etc/cron.d/fss-sync-up-file-system
echo '${dst_mount_target_private_ip}:${dst_export_path} ${dst_mount_path} nfs tcp,vers=3' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
echo '#${fss_sync_frequency} /usr/bin/flock -n /var/run/fss-sync-up-file-system.lck rsync -aHAXxv --numeric-ids --delete ${src_mount_path} ${dst_mount_path}' | sudo tee -a /etc/cron.d/fss-sync-up-file-system
touch /tmp/rsync.done
```
## How to use this module

1) Go to PrimaveraHome directory

```
$ cd PrimaveraHome
```

2) Update **env-vars** (or **env-vars.ps1** for Windows) with the required information. The file contains definitions of environment variables for your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure tenancy.

3) Update **terraform.tfvars** with the inputs for the architecture that you want to build. A running sample terraform.tfvars file for multiple availability domain architecture is available in previous section. The contents of sample file can be copied to create a running terraform.tfvars input file. Update db_admin_password with actual password in terraform.tfvars file.

4) Initialize Terraform. This will also download the latest terraform oci provider.


  ```
  $ terraform init
  ```
  ![terraform init](images/terraform-init.png)


5) Set environment variables by running source **env-vars** on your UNIX system or by running **env-vars.ps1** on your Windows system.

  ```
  $ source env-vars
  ```

6) Run terraform apply to create the infrastructure:

  ```
  $ terraform apply
  ```

  When you’re prompted to confirm the action, enter **yes**.

  When all components have been created, Terraform displays a completion message. For example: Apply complete! Resources: 47 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.


7) If you want to delete the infrastructure, run:

  ```
  $ terraform destroy
  ```

  When you’re prompted to confirm the action, enter **yes**.
